= Groundwork

Groundwork is a set of very minimal libraries to get going in https://go.dev/[Go].

== groundwork/__migration__

The migration package provides simple database schema migrations.
Migrations are defined in plain sql.

== groundwork/__noorm__

The noorm package provides convenient mapping for sql databases.
Queries are still plain sql. Noorm is not an orm.
